# DevLinks

DevLinks is a streamlined developer link management tool designed to empower developers by offering a centralized platform for managing and sharing their development resources. This frontend application makes it easy for developers to share their different profiles across platforms with just one link.

## Live Demo

Check out DevLinks live at [DevLinks Live](https://devlinks-nsir.onrender.com/).

## Important Note
DevLinks is currently a ***frontend*** project only. As of now, it does not support actual sharing of links or profiles. It is designed to demonstrate the user interface and user experience for managing developer links.

## Features

- **Centralized Hub**: Manage all your development platform links (code, docs, etc.) in one place using a ReactJS dynamic interface.
- **Effortless Profile Creation**: Formik streamlines user profile and developer link creation with validation for accuracy.
- **Live Preview**: See how your DevLinks profile appears to others with ReactJS real-time preview as you edit.
- **One-Click Sharing**: Seamlessly share your curated resources with colleagues.

## Tech Stack

- **ReactJS**: Used to build the application frontend. ReactJS is a fast JavaScript library due to its virtual DOM.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides class-based CSS directly in HTML elements, making development faster and easier.
- **Redux**: A JavaScript library that enables seamless data transfer between different components via a centralized data locker.
- **Formik**: A React open-source library that simplifies handling repetitive tasks like tracking values, errors, and visited fields, orchestrating validation, and handling submission.
